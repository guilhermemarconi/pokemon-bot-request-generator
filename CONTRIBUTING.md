## How can I contribute?

### Reporting bugs

#### Before submitting a bug report

Before creating a bug report, take a look at the issues page to know if the bug is already reported by someone else. If that's the case, you can contribute with the discussion there, and don't forget to include as many details as possible.

If you find a **Closed** bug report that seems like the same thing that you're experiencing, please open a new issue and include a link to the original report in the body of the new one.

#### How do I submit a good bug report?

Bugs are tracked as [Github issues](https://github.com/guilhermemarconi/pokemon-bot-request-generator/issues). Create an issue to report the bug that you've found.

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Describe the staps to reproduce the problem** in many deatils as possible. For example, start explaining which PokÃ©mon species you have selected, or which ball you chose in the list, the moves, etc. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did but how you did it**. For example, if you submitted the form before waiting for some info to load.
- **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
- **Include screenshots and/or animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
- **Include details about your device and/or configuration**, if possible, like browser's name and version.
